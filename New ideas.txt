Create class for each data point, consisting of private members:
- 100 readings
- Frequency
- Metadata
- Which spectrum it belongs to

Then perform methods on the class to e.g. calculate bad counts, excitations given a threshold


Don't want to just throw away data about error flags - but might still be worth using fun bitwise operations!
