- The name of the last spectrum doesn't show up in the spectroscopy viewer
- Can't do Rabi oscillations
- Need to reduce FPGA step size

- DDS does not update probe frequency on first step of spectrum, only when frequency change is called in subsequent steps
- Histogram on spectroscopy viewer crashes when more than one spectrum taken at once
- Thresholds must be adjusted twice at start, otherwise spectrum plots vertical line nonsense
- The message box doesn't move if you resize the viewer window
